        content: "The celebs took on the Toon after the high fashion gala—here's a sneak peek...The Met Gala may be about couture, but in Newcastle, it’s about culture—and that includes a legendary night out. After an evening draped in haute couture and archival fashion, the A-listers took their red-carpet glam straight into the neon-lit chaos of the Toon’s nightlife, swapping museum-worthy gowns for sky-high heels, shirtless blokes, and enough trebles to fuel a revolution.And where did they end up? Nowhere fancy, pet. Forget VIP booths and velvet ropes—this lot were up on the tables, soaking up the electric Geordie spirit like a proper night on the lash.Bad Bunny was the first to hop on the tables, tequila in one hand, blazer long abandoned. 'Mate, you’ve not lived until you’ve partied in Newcastle,' he reportedly yelled, downing a double vodka with the ease of a seasoned regular. Meanwhile, Gigi Hadid, still adorned in thousands of hours’ worth of beading, was caught dramatically singing along to Sam Fender’s *Seventeen Going Under*, clutching a treble like her life depended on it.'This is art. This is fashion,' she declared before someone handed her a jägerbomb.Tyla, swathed in Balmain’s 'fleeting beauty' sand dress, proved her dedication to the cause by walking barefoot through the Bigg Market for a sausage roll.'I had to get out of that dress somehow' she shrugged.'This city. This is what fashion should be about,'Vivienne Westwood once said. And honestly, if you can’t take your Met Gala finery through the streets of Newcastle and come out with a pasty and a few bruises, what’s the point?Until next year, MetGalaGeordie. Same time, same place. Just save us a seat in Greggs.",

        content: "Anna Wintour has been spotted getting her lay of the Toon before the inaugural Geordie Met Gala next Friday. There have been sightings of her in Eldon Square, by the coast and even at St James’ Park donning a Newcastle United top. She has judged every Met Gala since the 90s and was not keen on the idea of a Geordie Met Gala at first, reportedly saying Newcastle is charming but not quite New York.Eyewitnesses claim she was seen striding through Eldon Square with an entourage of assistants dressed head-to-toe in black, attempting to shield her from the neon glow of the Greggs signage. Security had to step in after a bold shopper mistook her for a Debenhams mannequin, an understandable error given her pristine posture and oversized sunglasses. Rumours swirled that she made an undercover visit to Fenwick where she was overheard discussing the window displays. One retail worker reported that she stared at a Barbour jacket for a solid minute, nodded once, and left.Perhaps the most shocking twist in her Newcastle tour came when she was spotted at St James’ Park wearing a Newcastle United top, a far cry from her usual Chanel and Dior ensembles. The sight was enough to cause mass confusion among passing football fans, with one onlooker claiming he had to check his pint to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Some speculate this was a diplomatic fashion move, an attempt to ingratiate herself with Newcastle’s die-hard fans ahead of the event. Others claim she is secretly working on a football-inspired editorial shoot for Vogue, possibly featuring Eddie Howe in Balenciaga. Either way, the image of Wintour in black and white stripes standing stone-faced in a sea of chanting fans is the kind of surreal crossover moment no one saw coming.For a woman accustomed to the New York skyline, Tynemouth’s windswept beaches might have been something of a culture shock. Yet she was seen by the coast standing motionless like a Renaissance painting, staring out at the North Sea, perhaps contemplating her career choices or simply deciding if the view was editorial enough for Vogue’s September issue. One beachgoer claims she watched a seagull swoop dangerously close to her sunglasses, to which she merely tilted her head in disapproval as though styling a misbehaving model. Sources say she left shortly after being offered a battered sausage.Despite her initial skepticism, Wintour’s full-scale tour of Newcastle suggests she is warming up to the Geordie Met Gala experiment. Could this be the moment Newcastle finally earns its place on the global fashion map. One insider claims she was overheard saying there’s a certain authenticity here which from Anna Wintour is practically a standing ovation. Whatever happens next Friday, one thing is clear Newcastle has made an unforgettable first impression on the First Lady of Fashion. And who knows, maybe next year we’ll see a Greggs pasty-themed Met Gala dress. Now that’s fashion with a bite.",
